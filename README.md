# omarchy-on-cachyos

## 1. Introduction

This project provides an installation script for implementing DHH's Omarchy configuration on top of CachyOS. Omarchy is an 'opinionated' desktop setup, based on Hyprland, that emphasizes simplicity and productivity, while CachyOS offers a performance-optimized Arch Linux distribution.

## 2. What This Script Does and Does Not Do

This installation script does the following three things:

 1) Clones Omarchy from its github repository 
 2) Makes adjustments to the Omarchy install scripts to support installation on CachyOS
 3) Launches the installation of Omarchy on an already setup CachyOS system

This script does not:
 
 1) Install CachyOS or any other Linux operating system
 2) Partition, format, or encrypt hard disks
 3) Install or configure a boot loader
 4) Install graphics drivers
 5) Install or configure a login display manager

All of the above need to be done when you install CachyOS. 

## 3. Important Notes

This script (and README.md) is intended primarily for the experienced Arch Linux user. The author of this README.md assumes the reader is comfortable using a shell/command line and is familiar with Arch specific terms such as AUR.

The philosophy behind this script is to produce a strong and stable blend of CachyOS and Omarchy that changes as little as possible between the two. This script does not add software or make configuration changes outside of what CachyOS or Omarchy provide as default, except when such software or configurations provided by CachyOS and Omarchy are in conflict. In these cases, the script will choose the following:

1. AUR helper: CachyOS uses Paru by default while Omarchy uses Yay. This script opts for Yay and will install it if not already installed.

2. Shell: CachyOS uses the Fish shell by default while Omarchy uses Bash. This script will keep Fish as the default interactive shell.

3. TLDR implementation: CachyOS installs Tealdeer by default, which is a TLDR implementation written in Rust. This script will preserve use of Tealdeer.

4. Mise: Omarchy will setup Mise to run automatically via mise-activate. This script will supply the right mise-activate command for the fish shell.

5. Login System: As a distribution, Omarchy skips installation of a login display manager. Instead, Hyprland autostarts and password protection is provided upon boot by the LUKS full disk encryption service. This script, however, assumes a display manager is installed. (Note: this script does not install a display manager, but also does not configure Hyprland to start automatically if a display manager is not installed.)

6. Full Disk Encryption: As a distribution, Omarchy automatically turns on full disk encryption via LUKS. This script, however, leaves this decision up to the user. CachyOS can be installed with or without full disk encryption, and this script will install Omarchy on either setup.  

## 4. Pre-Requisites

IMPORTANT: This script does not install CachyOS. You must do that separately (and first.) This script is intended to be run on a fresh installation of CachyOS with the following configuration choices made: (Note, for information on installing CachyOS, please refer to https://www.cachyos.org.) 

1. File System: You must choose BTRFS as the file system and Snapper as the snapshot manager. This aligns with CachyOS's default recommendation for most systems, and is required for Omarchy to properly function.

2. Shell: You must choose Fish as the default shell for this installation script to work properly. (This is the default CachyOS shell choice.)

3. Desktop Environment to Install: You can install a minimal system with no desktop environment or you can choose to install the CachyOS Hyprland Desktop Environment. If you have CachyOS install Hyprland, it will also install SDDM as the login display manager by default. Do not install GNOME or KDE.

4. Graphics Drivers for NVIDIA users: If you are using an NVIDIA GPU, install the recommended graphics driver via CachyOS. The script will turn off driver installation in Omarchy. 

Other configuration changes are up to you. Note, however, that this script has not been extensively tested on various CachyOS installations other than the author's own machine.
